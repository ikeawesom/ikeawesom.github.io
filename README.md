As a passionate freelance software and web developer with five years of experience, I possess proficiency in Python, C++, Java, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have successfully completed projects ranging from personal websites to full-stack e-commerce platforms. With expertise in frameworks such as ExpressJS and Flask coupled with designing tools like Figma and Photoshop, I am adept at developing visually appealing and responsive full stack services. 

Additionally, I have integrated payment gateways, including Stripe, to facilitate seamless transactions. My strong grasp of version control using Git, coupled with database management skills in MongoDB and SQL, enables me to deliver robust database solutions. Alongside my independent learning approach and intellectual capabilities, my leadership experience in national project events showcases my teamwork skills and dedication.

Being a versatile developer, I am driven to make impactful contributions in the field.
